Hello! My name is Pooya Khorrami and I am a member of the technical staff in the Artificial Intelligence Technology and Systems group at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. I received a PhD at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign working under the supervision of Professor Thomas S. Huang in the [Image Formation and Processing (IFP)](http://ifp-uiuc.github.io) group. 

I also received a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in 2013 and a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2011.
